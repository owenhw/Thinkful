## Segmentation of FIFA19 Players


### Dataset

Here I will be using the FIFA19 Players dataset. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) though I will be loading it from Thinkful's database. It contains information about 18207 players. 

While there are some legetimate critisms about this dataset, more accurate and unbiased data is not available particularly not in such a complete form. Moreover these ratings make headlines every year and are widely considered by the sport to be significant. Within the dataset some of the values are more raw while others have been manually edited as discussed in this [ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/2959703/fifa-17-player-ratings-system-blends-advanced-stats-and-subjective-scouting). 


### Use Case and Business Calue

It would require an undue ammount of time and resources to consider 18,000 players individually when building a team as a manager or recruiter. By clustering the players and deriving insights from their differences teams can narrow their focus as they look to hire players.


### Challanges
 - Identifying the correct number of clusers
 - Handeling and avoiding bias within the dataset
