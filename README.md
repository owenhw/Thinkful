This a public repository that I use for both syncing assingments and projects across multiple computers as well as for submitting assignments for grading.

Most things here are not intended for public consumption and are a work in progress. In particular my use of commits is something I'm working on improving.

I'm very excited about my journey into Data Science and coding!
