This a public repository that I use for both syncing assingments and projects across multiple computers as well as for submitting assignments for grading.

Most things here are not intended for public consumption and are a work in progress. This repository is also not an example of how to conform to typical VCS best practices. This is the first project that I have consistantly used VCS for. 

I'm very excited about my journey into Data Science and coding!
